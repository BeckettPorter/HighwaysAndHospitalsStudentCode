I tested that it works by just printing out what values I got from it and it worked correctly in multiple cases that I tested. |
| September 10th |  5:10 - 5:40   | I figured out a trick to prevent having to run through the algorithm. If the hospital price is less or equal to that of building a road, it is always cheaper to just build hospitals at every city. Other than that, I didn't get too much done because I honestly don't really know where to start with the algorithm, so I will ask tomorrow in class. I'm not totally sure what data structure will work best, I tried a queue at first but I don't think that would really work? I also spend a while messing with my IDE settings to fix how it automatically places brackets in a place I don't want them and I eventually figured it out. |

I will continue trying to figure it out tonight when I get home or have some more time. |

Had to kind of do a hacky workaround to get it to work when there was nothing in the Cities array but it works. It now passes 3 of the 6 tests as opposed to only 2 before. |

I don't think this made any difference to the output but it was kind of weird that I did it at 1, probably a typo. |

I also deleted all my old code, some of the comments might still be out of date though and reference how I used to do it so I'll need to fix that. I got it to give me answers very close to the target, but normally off by about 1. Need to figure out why this is happening, might be a loop boundary thing. It seems like it runs a looooot faster than it did before though so that's good. |

Now I am starting to implement path compression to optimize it, it already runs fast though. Just got weight balancing working, will need to get path compression working next. |

I don't know if it is working because the run speeds seem to be about the same. I also fixed my weight balancing algorithm because before it was doing the order calculations incorrectly. |
