I tested that it works by just printing out what values I got from it and it worked correctly in multiple cases that I tested. |
| September 10th |  5:10 - 5:40  | I figured out a trick to prevent having to run through the algorithm. If the hospital price is less or equal to that of building a road, it is always cheaper to just build hospitals at every city. Other than that, I didn't get too much done because I honestly don't really know where to start with the algorithm, so I will ask tomorrow in class. I'm not totally sure what data structure will work best, I tried a queue at first but I don't think that would really work? I also spend a while messing with my IDE settings to fix how it automatically places brackets in a place I don't want them and I eventually figured it out. |

I will continue trying to figure it out tonight when I get home or have some more time. |
